Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.
I enjoy helping people with their projects and collaborating with others. In my free time, I like to read books and learn new things.

I also love exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech world. 
When I'm not working on projects, you can find me hiking in nature or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. 
I'm always eager to meet new people and share knowledge, so feel free to reach out and connect!
